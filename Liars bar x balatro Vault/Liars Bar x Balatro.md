im trying to make a game that combines the card game aspect of liars bar and the addictive animation + joker system in balatro, im also trying to integrate this game in a local network multiplayer, maybe even an internet multiplayer. first thing im going to do is a [[State machine]], which will decide what state the cards are in for the animations. so for example if I have a wobble effect on the cards and we hold the card up with the mouse it should stop that animation and switch to the "held by mouse" state.

Here are some YouTube video [[Links]] I found that are useful.

the current parts of the game that I havent done yet : [[Current Tasks]]
